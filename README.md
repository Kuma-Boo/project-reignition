A Fan Remake of Sonic and the Secret Rings.

Originally released in 2007 for the Nintendo Wii, Sonic and the Secret Rings' initially saw a moderate amount of critical and commercial success. Despite this, its reputation has dwindled over time among fans. Some commonly cited complaints include:
 - Imprecise motion controls
 - Repetitive music
 - Unnecessary skills
 - Nonsensical level progression.

While this remake intends to remain largely faithful to the original ideas of Secret Rings, many things will be changed to create a more enjoyable experience.
