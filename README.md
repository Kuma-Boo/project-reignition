# sonic-wildfire-remake
A Fan Remake of Sonic and the Secret Rings.

Originally released for the Nintendo Wii in 2007 with a critical reception of "Only slightly better than 06", over the course of time many Sonic fans have called Sonic and the Secret Rings their least favorite Sonic game, with the main reasons cited being the Wii Remote's required motion controls, and nonsensical progression.

While this remake intends to keep the core of Secret Rings, many things are to be changed and overhauled.


**PRIMARY CHANGES**
- Controls have been entirely remapped to a traditional controller.
- Level Select now has a notification for critical story missions.
- "Seven Rings in Hand" is no longer the menu theme.
- Equipping Skill Rings before a mission is now skipped by default.
- Skills that improve control no longer exist.
- Skills that are simply weaker versions of other skills no longer exist.
- Overall game speed and responsiveness has been buffed.
- Time Break now maintains a smooth framerate.
