# sonic-wildfire-remake
A Fan Remake of Sonic and the Secret Rings.

Originally released for the Nintendo Wii in 2007 to a respectable level of critical and commercial success, Sonic and the Secret Rings' reputation has dwindled over time among fans. Some common complaints include:
 - Imprecise motion controls
 - Repetitive music
 - Unnecessary skills
 - Nonsensical level progression.

While this remake intends to keep the core ideas of Secret Rings, many things will be changed to create a more enjoyable experience.


<h2>Major Changes</h2>

- Controls will be remapped for a traditional controller.
- Level Select will have an indication for story-critical missions.
- "Seven Rings in Hand" will no longer be the menu theme.
- Equipping Skill Rings before a mission will be skipped by default.
- Skills that improve control will be equipped by default.
- Skills that are weaker versions of other skills will be removed.
- Time Break will maintain a smooth framerate.
