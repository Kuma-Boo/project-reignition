# sonic-wildfire-remake
A Fan Remake of Sonic and the Secret Rings.

Originally released for the Nintendo Wii in 2007 to high critical praise, Sonic and the Secret Rings' reputation has dwindled among fans over time. Common reasons include:
 - Required motion controls
 - Repetitive music
 - Unnecessary skills
 - Nonsensical level progression.

While this remake intends to keep the core ideas of Secret Rings, many things are to be changed and overhauled.


<h2>Planned Changes</h2>

- Controls will be remapped for a traditional controller.
- Level Select will have an indication for critical story missions.
- "Seven Rings in Hand" will no longer be the menu theme.
- Equipping Skill Rings before a mission will be skipped by default.
- Skills that improve control will be mostly removed.
- Skills that are weaker versions of other skills will be removed.
- Time Break will maintain a smooth framerate.
