event01_name	The World of the Book						
event01_1	ZZZ...						
event01_2	Um...						
event01_3	ZZZ...						
event01_4	Hmph!	Come on...					
event01_5	Hey, wake up!						
event01_6	Yaaaaawwn! Boy, is it that late\nalready? What time is it?	Yaaaaawwn! It's so late already, huh.\nWhat time is it now?					
event01_7	Huh?	Hm?					
event01_8	You are the blue hedgehog.	You must be the blue hedgehog.					
event01_9	Ahh...What the...!	WHOA!					
event01_10	Do not be alarmed!\nI am Shahra, the Genie of the Ring.	Don't be so alarmed!\nI am Shahra, the Genie of the Ring.					
event01_11	"...You know,\nlike ""Aladdin and the Magic Lamp""...?"						
event01_12	Don't think I've read that.	Haven't read that yet.					
event01_13	What?\nYou've got to be kidding me!	Eh...? Will this be okay, I wonder...					
event01_14	It's the best story of all the Arabian\nNights! Or, at least the second best...	Of all the stories from the Arabian Nights,\nit's one of the most interesting...					
event01_15	...But that's besides the point.\nPlease, look at this!	...Anyway, that explanation can wait.\nPlease take a look at this!					
event01_16	Hey, the page is blank!	The pages are blank?!					
event01_17	Our world...						
event01_18	...The world of the Arabian Nights is vanishing.						
event01_19	Vanishing? But how?	Vanishing? Why?					
event01_20	This is the work of an incredibly\nevil spirit...The Erazor Djinn.	That is the work of an evil genie, Erazor Djinn...					
event01_21	Erazor...Djinn?						
event01_22	Yes.						
event01_23	He used his evil magic to become even\nmore powerful.	He is a genie that possesses incredibly strong magic.					
event01_24	He could not bear to simply\nremain in the book any longer.	Because of that, he did not know what to do with his power,					
event01_25	And so he has begun to\nset the inscriptions free,	And could no longer stand to remain within the book.					
event01_26	Absorbing the power of\nthe book itself.	He has begun harvesting the book's pages\nand absorbing its power.					
event01_27	The power of the book?	Absorbing the book's power...					
event01_28	If our world ceases to exist,	If our world disappears,					
event01_29	Then not only will those stories be silenced forever,	Then not only will all these stories become unreadable,					
event01_30	But the Erazor Djinn will then be\nunleashed into your world.	But with the power he absorbs,\nit's possible he will enter your world as well.					
event01_31	That definitely sounds like trouble.\nBut, what do you want me to do?	That definitely does sound like trouble.\nSo? What do you want from me?					
event01_32	I want you to stop him...	I want you...					
event01_33	You mush stop the Erazor Djinn.	...To stop the Erazor Djinn.					
event01_34	Only you, the blue hedgehog, can do it.	Only you, the blue hedgehog,\nare capable of doing that.					
event01_35	Hmm.						
event01_36	So this guy needs someone\nto put him in his place, does he?	So you want me to play around\nwith this selfish kiddo for a while, huh.					
event01_37	I suppose I can help out with that.\nIt might even be fun.	I do want to help,\nbut at the end of the day,					
event01_38	But... this is all just something\nout of a storybook, right?	This is all happening in a book, right?					
event01_39	How am I supposed to do anything\nabout that?	What should we do?					
event01_40	That's easy.						
event01_41	You are my master, having called\nforth the Genie of the Ring.	As the Genie of the Ring, those\nwho summon me become my master,					
event01_42	As such,\nI am able to grant your wishes.	And I can grant wishes to that person.					
event01_43	Simple wishes, at any rate.	Though I can only handle simple wishes...					
event01_44	Bringing you into the world of the\nArabian Nights is within my power.	Taking you into the world of\nthe Arabian Nights is doable.					
event01_45	What?! Inside that book?	Huh?! Inside the book?					
event01_46	Now please,\nplace the ring on your finger!	Now, please put this ring on your finger!					
event01_47	Like this?	...Like this?					
event01_48	OUCH!\nHey, take it easy!	OUCH!\nOw-ow-ow...					
event01_49	My apologies, O Master,\nbut now the contract has been sealed.	I am sorry, my Master.\nThe contract is now sealed.					
event01_50	Contract?						
event01_51	Yes. As Master of the Ring,\nI am now bound to protect you.						
event01_52	Now, rub the ring!	Now, please rub the ring.					
event01_53	Like...Like this?	Will this do?					
event01_54	"""O Master of the ring, what is thy wish?"""	What do you wish for, O Master? I am at your command.					
event01_55	Achoo!\nAchoo!						
event01_56	How about a handkerchief for starters!\nMake that a few!	Give me some handkerchiefs!\nLots of them.					
event01_57	Thanks! You're a lifesaver! You see,\nI caught this cold yesterday, and...	Oh man, you're a real lifesaver!\nI actually had this cold since yesterday, so...					
event01_58	Please, be serious!!	Please take this seriously!!					
event01_59	Okay, okay.\nThanks for the hankies, though.	Yeah, I know.\nI only asked for some hankies, right?					
event01_60	Oh please, someone tell me that\nthis isn't really happening...	Oh, goodness...Will this really be alright...					
event01_61	Alright, let's go!	Now, let's go.					
event01_62	Take me to this world of\nthe Arabian Nights!	Take me to the world of\nthe Arabian Nights!					
event01_63	As you wish, Master!	Understood, Master!					
event01_64	Quit it, will you!	Cut that out!					
event01_65	My name's Sonic.\nSonic the Hedgehog!	I'm Sonic!\nSonic the Hedgehog.					
event01_66	Very well then, Sonic.	Understood, Sonic.					
event01_67	...The legendary hedgehog.						
event01_68	Here we go!\nInto the world of the Arabian Nights!	Now let us go!\nTo the world of the Arabian Nights!					
event01_69	OK!	OK.
