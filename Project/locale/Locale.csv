event01_1	ZZZ...						
event01_2	Um...						
event01_3	ZZZ...						
event01_4	Hmph!	Come on...					
event01_5	Hey, wake up!						
event01_6	Yaaaaawwn! Boy, is it that late\nalready? What time is it?	Yaaaaawwn! It's so late already, huh.\nWhat time is it now?					
event01_7	Huh?	Hm?					
event01_8	You are the blue hedgehog.	You must be the blue hedgehog.					
event01_9	Ahh...What the...!	WHOA!					
event01_10	Do not be alarmed!\nI am Shahra, the Genie of the Ring.	Don't be so alarmed!\nI am Shahra, the Genie of the Ring.					
event01_11	"...You know,\nlike ""Aladdin and the Magic Lamp""...?"						
event01_12	Don't think I've read that.	Haven't read that yet.					
event01_13	What?\nYou've got to be kidding me!	Eh...? Will this be okay, I wonder...					
event01_14	It's the best story of all the Arabian\nNights! Or, at least the second best...	Of all the stories from the Arabian Nights,\nit's stands as one of the most fun...					
event01_15	...But that's besides the point.\nPlease, look at this!	...Anyway, that explanation can wait.\nPlease take a look at this!					
event01_16	Hey, the page is blank!	The pages are blank?!					
event01_17	Our world...						
event01_18	...The world of the Arabian Nights is vanishing.						
event01_19	Vanishing? But how?	Vanishing? Why?					
event01_20	This is the work of an incredibly\nevil spirit...The Erazor Djinn.	That is the work of an evil genie, Erazor Djinn...					
event01_21	Erazor...Djinn?						
event01_22	Yes.						
event01_23	He used his evil magic to become even\nmore powerful.	He is a genie that possesses incredibly strong magic.					
event01_24	He could not bear to simply\nremain in the book any longer.	Because of that, he did not know what to do with his power,					
event01_25	And so he has begun to\nset the inscriptions free,	And could no longer stand to remain within the book.					
event01_26	Absorbing the power of\nthe book itself.	He has begun harvesting the book's pages\nand absorbing its power.					
event01_27	The power of the book?	Absorbing the book's power...					
event01_28	If our world ceases to exist,	If our world disappears,					
event01_29	Then not only will those stories be silenced forever,	Then not only will all these stories become unreadable,					
event01_30	But the Erazor Djinn will then be\nunleashed into your world.	But with the power he absorbs,\nit's possible he will enter your world as well.					
event01_31	That definitely sounds like trouble.\nBut, what do you want me to do?	That definitely does sound like trouble.\nSo? What do you want from me?					
event01_32	I want you to stop him...	I want you...					
event01_33	You mush stop the Erazor Djinn.	...To stop the Erazor Djinn.					
event01_34	Only you, the blue hedgehog, can do it.	Only you, the blue hedgehog,\nare capable of doing that.					
event01_35	Hmm.	Hm.					
event01_36	So this guy needs someone\nto put him in his place, does he?	So you want me to play around\nwith this selfish kiddo for a while, huh.					
event01_37	I suppose I can help out with that.\nIt might even be fun.	I do want to help,\nbut at the end of the day,					
event01_38	But... this is all just something\nout of a storybook, right?	This is all happening in a book, right?					
event01_39	How am I supposed to do anything\nabout that?	What should we do?					
event01_40	That's easy.						
event01_41	You are my master, having called\nforth the Genie of the Ring.	As the Genie of the Ring, those\nwho summon me become my master,					
event01_42	As such,\nI am able to grant your wishes.	And I can grant wishes to that person.					
event01_43	Simple wishes, at any rate.	Though I can only handle simple wishes...					
event01_44	Bringing you into the world of the\nArabian Nights is within my power.	Taking you into the world of\nthe Arabian Nights is doable.					
event01_45	What?! Inside that book?	Huh?! Inside the book?					
event01_46	Now please,\nplace the ring on your finger!	Now, please put this ring on your finger!					
event01_47	Like this?	...Like this?					
event01_48	OUCH!\nHey, take it easy!	OUCH!\nOw-ow-ow...					
event01_49	My apologies, O Master,\nbut now the contract has been sealed.	I am sorry, my Master.\nThe contract is now sealed.					
event01_50	Contract?						
event01_51	Yes. As Master of the Ring,\nI am now bound to protect you.						
event01_52	Now, rub the ring!	Now, please rub the ring.					
event01_53	Like...Like this?	Will this do?					
event01_54	"""O Master of the ring, what is thy wish?"""	What do you wish for, O Master? I am at your command.					
event01_55	Achoo!\nAchoo!						
event01_56	How about a handkerchief for starters!\nMake that a few!	Give me some handkerchiefs!\nLots of them.					
event01_57	Thanks! You're a lifesaver! You see,\nI caught this cold yesterday, and...	Oh man, you're a real lifesaver!\nI actually had this cold since yesterday, so...					
event01_58	Please, be serious!!	Please take this seriously!!					
event01_59	Okay, okay.\nThanks for the hankies, though.	Yeah, I know.\nI only asked for some hankies, right?					
event01_60	Oh please, someone tell me that\nthis isn't really happening...	Oh, goodness...Will this really be alright...					
event01_61	Alright, let's go!	Now, let's go.					
event01_62	Take me to this world of\nthe Arabian Nights!	Take me to the world of\nthe Arabian Nights!					
event01_63	As you wish, Master!	Understood, Master!					
event01_64	Quit it, will you!	Cut that out!					
event01_65	My name's Sonic.\nSonic the Hedgehog!	I'm Sonic!\nSonic the Hedgehog.					
event01_66	Very well then, Sonic.	Understood, Sonic.					
event01_67	...The legendary hedgehog.						
event01_68	Here we go!\nInto the world of the Arabian Nights!	Now let us go!\nTo the world of the Arabian Nights!					
event01_69	OK!	OK.					
event01_70	Now THIS is first-class!	I'm countin' on ya for first-class transportation!
